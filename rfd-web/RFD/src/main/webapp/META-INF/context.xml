<!-- 
   If a project containing a META-INF/context.xml file is added to one 
	of these Tomcat servers in WTP, the context configuration found in this file 
	will be included in the context for that project when server.xml, or separate 
	context XML file in WTP 2.0.x and later, is file copied as part of publishing 
	the server. Typically when using m2e-wtp, the file should be 
	src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml. 
	When adding the configuration from the META-INF/context.xml file, all child 
	elements of the <Context> are copied as well as its attributes, excluding 
	the "path" and "docBase" attributes.
